About audit logging
-------------------

The audit logging feature allows you to monitor and track activities within rellational database systems, which helps you cope with unauthorized access, data breaches, or fraudulent activities ensuring data integrity and security. Using audit logs enables you to maintain compliance with regulations and standards set by a government or an industry. The audit logging is also a tool for investigating and resolving data discrepancies, troubleshooting system errors, and optimizing database performance.

  * Identify intrusion attempts or unauthorized activities within the organization's IT environment

Compliance
  * Use audit logs as a regulatory compliance evidence to demonstrate that the organization meets industry or state regulations during audits
  * Track access to sensitive data to comply with data privacy regulations

Accountability
  * Have specific actions attributed to individual users to hold them accountable for their activities within the system
  * Track changes to databases and systems to hold users accountable for alterations or configurations

Operational security
  * Monitor and analyze audit logs to proactively identify and resolve security incidents
  * Analyze audit logs to detect and respond to potential security threats

Incident management and root cause analysis
  * Investigate an incident with audit logs as a detailed trail of events leading up to the incidents
  * Analyze the root cause of an incident with audit logs providing data on actions and events that may have led to the incident

System performance optimization
  * Monitor and analyze system performance to identify bottlenecks.
  * Analyzing audit logs to assess resource utilization patterns and optimize the system configuration

Data recovery and disaster planning
  * Use audit logs for data restoration in case of data loss or system failure
  * Analyze audit logs to improve system resilience and disaster planning strategies by identify potential points of failure

Change management and version control
  * Use audit logs to keep a record of changes made to databases, software, and configurations, ensuring a proper version control

Use cases
---------

Typically, capabilities of the audit logging feature are most appreciated by organizations or enterprises that value data security, integrity, and compliance. The audit logging has a wide range of applications in various industries:

Finance and banking

How it works
------------

You can enable, configure, and use the audit logging feature on the service level or the database level with Aiven for PostgreSQL 11+ Pro Plan as an ``avnadmin`` superuser.

To use the audit logging on your service (database) for collecting logs in Aiven for PostgreSQL, you need to :doc:`enable and configure this feature </docs/products/postgresql/howto/pgaudit-logging>` in `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io>`_ or using `Aiven API <https://api.aiven.io/doc/>`_ or :doc:`Aiven CLI </docs/tools/cli>`.

When enabled on your service, the audit logging can be configured so that it addresses your specific needs. There are a few `audit logging parameters <https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/tree/6afeae52d8e4569235bf6088e983d95ec26f13b7#readme>`_ that you might want to configure for that purpose:

``pgaudit.targetDatabases``
  Names of databases where the audit logging is to be enabled
``pgaudit.log`` (default: none)
  Classes of statements to be logged by the session audit logging
``pgaudit.log_catalog`` (default: on)	
  Whether the session audit logging should be enabled for a statement with all relations in pg_catalog
``pgaudit.log_client``
  Whether log messages should be visible to a client process, such as ``psql``
``pgaudit.log_level``
  Log level that should be used for log entries
``pgaudit.log_parameter`` (default: off)
  Whether audit logs should include the parameters passed with the statement
``pgaudit.log_parameter_max_size`` 
  Maximum size (in bytes) of a parameter's value that can be logged
``pgaudit.log_relation`` (default: off)
  Whether a separate log entry for each relation (for example, TABLE or VIEW) referenced in a SELECT or DML statement should be created
``pgaudit.log_rows``
  Whether the audit logging should include the rows retrieved or affected by a statement (with the rows field located after the parameter field)
``pgaudit.log_statement`` (default: on)
  Whether the audit logging should include the statement text and parameters
``pgaudit.log_statement_once`` (default: off)
  Whether the audit logging should include the statement text and parameters in the first log entry for a statement/ sub-statement combination (as opposed to including them in all the entries)
``pgaudit.role``
  Master role to use for an object audit logging

.. topic:: Audit logging parameters

    For information on all the parameters available for configuring the audit logging, see `Settings <https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/tree/6afeae52d8e4569235bf6088e983d95ec26f13b7#readme>`_.

You can access the collected logs by :ref:`integrating with a service monitoring and analyzing logs, for example, Aiven for OpenSearch速 <enable-log-integration>`. Finally, to visuaize your logs, you can use :doc:`OpenSearch Dashboards </docs/products/opensearch/dashboards>`.

To disable the audit logging on your service (database), you can use `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io>`_, `Aiven API <https://api.aiven.io/doc/>`_, or :doc:`Aiven CLI </docs/tools/cli>` for :ref:`modifying your service's advanced configuration <disable-pgaudit>`. 

Limitations
